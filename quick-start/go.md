# Telepresence Quick Start - **Go**

In this guide, we'll give you a hands-on tutorial with Telepresence and Golang. To go through this tutorial, the only thing you'll need is a computer that runs Docker Desktop >=20.10.7. We'll give you a pre-configured remote Kubernetes cluster and a Docker container to run locally.

If you don't have Docker Desktop already installed, go to the [Docker download page](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and install Docker.

## 1. Get a free remote cluster

Telepresence connects your local workstation with a remote Kubernetes cluster. In this tutorial, we'll start with a pre-configured, remote cluster.

1. <Login urlParams="docs_source=telepresence-quick-start&login_variant=free-cluster-activation" origin="telepresence-novice-go-quick-start" />
2. Go to the <DCPLink>Service Catalog</DCPLink> to see all the services deployed on your cluster.
   <EmojivotoServicesList/>
    The Service Catalog gives you a consolidated view of all your services across development, staging, and production. After exploring the Service Catalog, continue with this tutorial to test the application in your demo cluster.

<DemoClusterWarning />

<div className="docs-opaque-section">

## 2. Try the Emojivoto application

The remote cluster is running the Emojivoto application, which consists of four services. Test out the application:

1. Go to the <ExternalIp>Emojivoto webapp</ExternalIp> and vote for some emojis.
   <Alert severity="info">
   If the link to the remote demo cluster doesn't work, make sure you don't have an <strong>ad blocker</strong> preventing it from opening.
   </Alert>

2. Now, click on the 游꼴 emoji. You'll see that a bug is present, and voting 游꼴 doesn't work.

## 3. Run the docker container

We'll run the `voting-svc` service locally since the bug is present in that service, to save you time, we have a docker container with this service running and all you'll need to fix the bug.

1. Run the Docker container locally: 

  <Platform.TabGroup>
    <Platform.MacOSTab>
      <DockerCommand osType="macos" language="go" />
    </Platform.MacOSTab>

    <Platform.GNULinuxTab>
      <DockerCommand osType="linux" language="go" />
    </Platform.GNULinuxTab>

    <Platform.WindowsTab>
      <DockerCommand osType="windows" language="go" />
    </Platform.WindowsTab>
  </Platform.TabGroup>

2. The application is failing due to a little bug inside this service which uses gRPC to communicate with the others services. We can use `grpcurl` to test the gRPC endpoint and see the error by running:

  ```
  $ grpcurl -v -plaintext -import-path ./proto -proto Voting.proto localhost:8081 emojivoto.v1.VotingService.VoteDoughnut

    Resolved method descriptor:
    rpc VoteDoughnut ( .emojivoto.v1.VoteRequest ) returns ( .emojivoto.v1.VoteResponse );

    Request metadata to send:
    (empty)

    Response headers received:
    (empty)

    Response trailers received:
    content-type: application/grpc
    Sent 0 requests and received 0 responses
    ERROR:
      Code: Unknown
      Message: ERROR
  ```

3. In order to fix the bug, the docker container comes with an embedded IDE that runs in the browser, you can go to <a href="http://localhost:8083" target="_blank">http://localhost:8083</a> and open `api/main.go` here we are going to delete the line `5` since we are not going to use the `"fmt"` package anymore.

  ```go
  3 import (
  4  "context"
  5  "fmt" // delete this line
  6
  7  pb "github.com/buoyantio/emojivoto/emojivoto-voting-svc/gen/proto"
  ```

  and also replace the line `21`:

  ```go
  20 func (pS *PollServiceServer) VoteDoughnut(_ context.Context, _ *pb.VoteRequest) (*pb.VoteResponse, error) {
  21   return nil, fmt.Errorf("ERROR")
  22 }
  ```
  with
  ```go
  20 func (pS *PollServiceServer) VoteDoughnut(_ context.Context, _ *pb.VoteRequest) (*pb.VoteResponse, error) {
  21   return pS.vote(":doughnut:")
  22 }
  ```
  Then save the file (`Ctrl+s` or `Menu -> File -> Save`) and now we can verify that the error is fixed now:

  ```
  $ grpcurl -v -plaintext -import-path ./proto -proto Voting.proto localhost:8081 emojivoto.v1.VotingService.VoteDoughnut

    Resolved method descriptor:
    rpc VoteDoughnut ( .emojivoto.v1.VoteRequest ) returns ( .emojivoto.v1.VoteResponse );

    Request metadata to send:
    (empty)

    Response headers received:
    content-type: application/grpc

    Response contents:
    {
    }

    Response trailers received:
    (empty)
    Sent 0 requests and received 1 response
  ```

## 4. Telepresence intercept

1. Now the bug is fixed, we we'll use Telepresence to intercept *all* the traffic through our local service, to do that, inside the container you can run:
  ```
  $ telepresence intercept voting --port 8081:8080

    Using Deployment voting
    intercepted
      Intercept name         : voting
      State                  : ACTIVE
      Workload kind          : Deployment
      Destination            : 127.0.0.1:8081
      Service Port Identifier: 8080
      Volume Mount Point     : /tmp/telfs-XXXXXXXXX
      Intercepting           : all TCP connections
  ```
  Now you can go back to <ExternalIp>Emojivoto webapp</ExternalIp> and you'll see that voting for 游꼴 woks as expected.

2. We just created an intercept, this tell Telepresence where to send traffic. In this example we sent all the traffic destined to `voting-svc` to the local Dockerized version of the service. In this way we intercept *all the traffic* to our local `voting-svc` service and since we already fixed it, now it works.

<Alert severity="success">
  <strong>Congratulations!</strong> Traffic to the remote service is now being routed to your local laptop, and you can see how the local fix works on the remote environment!
</Alert>

## 5. Telepresence intercept with a preview URL

Preview URLs allows you to safely share your development environment. With this approach, you can try and test your local service more accurately because you have a total control about which traffic is handled through your service, all of this thank to the preview URL. 

1. First leave the current intercept: 

  ```
  $ telepresence leave voting
  ```

2. Then login to telepresence: 

  <LoginCommand />

3. Create an intercept, which will tell Telepresence to send traffic to the service in our container instead of the service in the cluster. When prompted for ingress configuration, all default values should be correct as displayed below.

  <UserInterceptCommand language="go" />

4. If you access the <ExternalIp>Emojivoto webapp</ExternalIp> application on your remote cluster and vote for the 游꼴 emoji, you'll see the bug is still present.

5. Vote for the 游꼴 emoji using the <PreviewUrl language="go">Preview URL</PreviewUrl> obtained in the previous step, and you will see that the bug is fixed, since traffic is being routed to the fixed version which is running locally.

You've intercepted a service in one of our demo clusters, now you can use Telepresence to [intercept a service in your own environment](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/telepresence/latest/howtos/intercepts/)!
