By default, the Telepresence proxy runs in the cluster as an unprivileged user; as built, the proxy image gives up root privileges. However, when the proxy needs to bind to privileged ports, it _must_ run as root. Instead of using the security context feature of Kubernetes to gain root, Telepresence now uses a different image that does not give up root privileges. This allows Telepresence to run in clusters that lock down the Kubernetes security context feature.
