The container method no longer uses `ifconfig` magic and `socat` to connect the local container to the cluster, relying on `ssh` port forwarding instead. If you've had trouble with Telepresence's use of the Docker bridge interface (typically `docker0` on Linux, unavailable on Windows), this change avoids all of that. This is technically a breaking change, as ports 38022 and 38023 are used by the new machinery. Those ports are now unavailable for user code. In practice, most users should not notice a difference.
